# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This Code of Conduct outlines the standards of behavior expected from all members of Group 31 throughout the DSCI 522 project. Our goal is to maintain a respectful, transparent, collaborative, and professional working environment that enables all teammates to contribute effectively.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project-related interactions, including but not limited to GitHub Discussions and Issues, Slack communication, email exchanges, group meetings (virtual or in person), and collaboration on code, documents, and project planning. It also applies in any public context where a team member is representing the project or group.

## Our Pledges

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone. We commit to a team culture grounded in:

-   Respect: treating each teammate with courtesy and consideration.

-   Transparency: communicating openly about progress, challenges, deadlines, and availability.

-   Collaboration: supporting one another and sharing responsibilities fairly.

-   Professionalism: maintaining a constructive, responsible, and reliable approach to all project tasks.

-   Empathy: recognizing the humanity, challenges, and individual contexts of team members.

## Expected Behavior

All team members agree to conduct themselves in ways that support a positive and productive working environment. This includes:

-   Communicating clearly, kindly, and professionally.

-   Being responsive within reasonable timeframes and notifying teammates of expected delays or challenges.

-   Providing constructive and respectful feedback, and accepting feedback graciously.

-   Acknowledging mistakes and working collaboratively to address problems.

-   Contributing fairly to code, writing, discussions, decision-making, and meetings.

-   Using inclusive language and being mindful of how actions or words may impact others.

-   Helping maintain an environment where everyone feels welcome and supported.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Behavior that undermines this environment is not permitted. Examples include, but are not limited to:

-   Use of sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome sexual attention or advances

-   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

-   Public or private harassment

-   Disrespectful, dismissive, or hostile communication

-   Publishing private information (such as physical or email addresses) without explicit permission

-   Persistently being unresponsive without notice

-   Withholding information essential for team progress

-   Sabotaging, blocking, or undermining the project

-   Any form of discrimination or harassment

-   Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or academic setting

## Responsibilities

Team members and maintainers are responsible for clarifying expected standards and ensuring the Code of Conduct is upheld. They may take appropriate and fair corrective actions in response to any instance of unacceptable behavior. This includes removing or editing contributions (such as comments, commits, issues, or documentation) that violate this Code, or temporarily/permanently restricting participation if necessary.

Failure to enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may result in further action decided by the rest of the team or by course instructional staff.

## Reporting and Conflict Resolution

If a concern arises, the following process will be used:

(1) Direct conversation: Individuals involved may first try to resolve the issue privately and professionally.

(2) Reporting within the team: If unresolved, any teammate may confidentially report the issue to another team member of their choice.

(3) Team discussion: The group will collectively discuss the matter and work toward a fair, transparent resolution.

(4) Escalation: If the team cannot reach a resolution, the concern will be escalated to the course instructional staff for further guidance.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [ji778\@student.ubc.ca](mailto:ji778@student.ubc.ca){.email} . All reports will be reviewed and investigated, and the project team will respond in a manner they determine to be fair and appropriate based on the circumstances. The project team will maintain confidentiality regarding the individual submitting the report. Additional details about enforcement procedures may be provided separately.

## Commitment

By participating in this project, each member of Group 31 agrees to abide by this Code of Conduct and uphold a healthy, respectful, and productive team environment.
