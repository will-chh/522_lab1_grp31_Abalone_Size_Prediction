# Contributing to the Abalone Age Predictor Project

(modified from Breast Cancer Predictor contributing document) This outlines how to propose a change to the Abalone Age Predictor Project.

## Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If you've found a bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal reprex.

## Pull Request Process

-   We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).

-   New code should follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) or [PEP8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

## How to Contribute

Follow the steps below to contribute to the Abalone Age Predictor Project:

#### 1. Create a new branch

Create a separate branch for each feature, fix, or documentation update.

Example: git branch fix_preprocessing_issues

#### 2. Make your changes

-   Follow the tidyverse style guide (R) or PEP8 style guide (Python).

-   Keep changes focused and limited to a single purpose.

-   Add tests, examples, or documentation updates if appropriate.

#### 3. Commit your work

Write clear and descriptive commit messages.

Example: git commit -m "Fix scaling error in preprocessing step"

#### 4. Push your branch

Example: git push origin fix_preprocessing_issues

#### 5. Open a Pull Request (PR)

On GitHub:

-   Open a PR from your branch into main.

-   Briefly describe the purpose of the change.

-   Link the associated Issue.

-   Note any tests or verification performed.

#### 6. Request a review

At least one team member must review and approve the PR before it is merged into main.

## Commit Guidelines

-   Write clear and descriptive commit messages.

-   Commit frequently when meaningful progress is made.

-   Keep commits focused—avoid mixing unrelated changes.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, concern, or inconsistency:

Open a GitHub Issue describing the problem, or notify any teammate directly if the issue is sensitive.
