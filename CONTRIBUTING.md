(modified from Breast Cancer Predictor contributing document)
This outlines how to propose a change to the Abalone Age Predictor Project. 

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If you've found a bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal reprex.

### Pull Request Process

- We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).

- New code should follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) or [PEP8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

### How to Contribute

- Create a new branch for each feature, fix, or update.

- Push your work to the branch and open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub.

- At least one member of the team must review and approve the PR before it is merged into main.

### Commit Guidelines

- Write clear and descriptive commit messages.

- Commit frequently when meaningful progress is made.

- Keep commits focused—avoid mixing unrelated changes.


### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, concern, or inconsistency:

Open a GitHub Issue describing the problem, or notify any teammate directly if the issue is sensitive.
